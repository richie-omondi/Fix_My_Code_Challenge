# 0x00-challenge

`Fix my code`` is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

Please download the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!
